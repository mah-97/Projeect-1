HoopHero brings live NBA stats straight to the tips of your fingers. This app allows users to search for their favorite players and access their updated season stats.

The HTML code uses elements such as headings, paragraphs, forms, and divs to create the structure of the page. The JS code uses the fetch method to make a request to an API endpoint, which retrieves player information in the form of JSON data. The .then method is used to handle the response and parse it as JSON. The innerHTML property is used to update the content of the page with the player information. The event listener is used to listen for the submit event on the form, then it triggers the code to make the API request and update the page.

My approach was to create a simple web page that allows the user to search for a player, and retrieve their stats for the user.
